# Francisco Vazquez

I am a Mechanical Engineer with practical experience in supply chain, logistics, and process improvement.

I specialize in being the bridge between operations and data. I have a solid background in supply chain analysis, but my real passion is transforming complex data into strategic decisions. I have developed dashboards in Power BI, automated ETL workflows, and analyzed large volumes of data from systems like SAP and Snowflake to improve operational efficiency and solve critical business problems.

## Currently Learning

I am actively expanding my technical skills, and my main focus right now is **Python**.

I am deeply interested in everything related to the world of data.

I am looking to apply my industry experience and combine it with advanced programming tools to tackle new challenges in data analysis.
